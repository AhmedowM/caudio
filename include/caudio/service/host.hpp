/**
 * @file host.hpp
 * @brief Host: runs a Service in-process without desktop daemon scaffolding.
 * @ingroup caudio_service
 *
 * A native host (for example an Android foreground service) needs to own the
 * service lifecycle directly: start it on a worker thread, observe readiness,
 * request cooperative cancellation, and wait for a clean shutdown. Host wraps
 * that pattern so every host does not reimplement thread and stop-token
 * handling.
 *
 * Host always creates its Service with `ServiceConfig::inProcess = true`, so
 * no lock file, PID file, socket, IPC server, or shared memory is created.
 * Desktop code should keep using `Service::create` and the daemon entry
 * points; desktop behavior is unchanged.
 *
 * @code
 * caudio::service::ServiceConfig cfg;
 * cfg.runtime.database = "/data/app/caudio/caudio.db";
 * cfg.runtime.logs = "/data/app/caudio/logs";
 * auto host = caudio::service::Host::create(cfg);
 * if (!host) { ... }
 * // ... use host->service() ...
 * host->stop();
 * @endcode

 *
 * Lifetime: Create with `create()`, which starts the service loop before
 * returning. `stop()` requests cancellation and waits. The destructor does the
 * same, so an early return cannot leak the worker thread.
 *
 * Thread safety: `requestStop()`, `running()`, `ready()`, and `error()` are
 * safe to call from any thread. `wait()` and `stop()` must not be called from
 * the worker thread (it cannot join itself) and must not run concurrently with
 * each other.
 *
 * The wrapped Service is not thread-safe for concurrent command calls; a host
 * must serialize any command dispatch it performs through `service()`.
