/**
 * @file wire.hpp
 * @brief Dep-free wire vocabulary shared by the engine and the IPC layer.
 * @defgroup caudio_types caudio wire value types
 * @details First inhabitant of the `caudio::types` layer: plain scalar types
 * that both `caudio::engine` and `caudio::ipc` depend on, so neither component
 * has to include the other. `RepeatMode` and `PlaybackState` cross the
 * daemon/client boundary (fields of `caudio::ipc::Status` and of several
 * commands) and have a fixed `std::uint8_t` underlying type. Their JSON wire
 * text lives in `types/format.hpp`, and its inverse in
 * `types/parse.hpp`).
 *
 * These values are owned directly by `caudio::types`. This
 * layer is deliberately dependency-free (no `fwd.hpp`, no std headers) so it
 * can sit at the bottom of the component graph.
