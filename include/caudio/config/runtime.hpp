/**
 * @file runtime.hpp
 * @brief Explicit, platform-neutral runtime directories for a host process.
 * @ingroup caudio_config
 *
 * Desktop discovery (XDG variables, HOME, LOCALAPPDATA, temp directories) is
 * convenient for a CLI but wrong for a sandboxed host such as Android. This
 * structure lets a host provide every persistent location up front. The core
 * validates and creates the supplied paths; it never invents Android or
 * desktop defaults from this object.
 *
 * All fields are optional. An empty field means "not supplied by the host";
 * callers that retain desktop behavior may leave the whole structure empty.
 * `logs` is a directory: the service writes `caudio.log` inside it. `cache`
 * and `importedMedia` are reserved for host-side import/copy workflows and are
 * not touched by the playback engine.

 * - `logs`: directory for service log files.
 * - `cache`: disposable cache directory.
 * - `importedMedia`: directory for app-private imported media copies.
 * - `socket`: explicit local transport endpoint, when the platform uses one.
 *
 * The Android adapter is expected to map these to `Context.filesDir`,
 * `Context.noBackupFilesDir`, and `Context.cacheDir`. The core does not infer
 * any of them.
