# SetupFFmpeg.cmake -- FFmpeg provider (kept for CI fallback path only)
#
# The default provider is system FFmpeg found by FindFFmpeg.cmake.
# The trimmed provider is built out-of-tree by scripts/build-ffmpeg.py and
# consumed via FFmpeg_ROOT or CAUDIO_TRIMMED_ROOT.
#
# This fallback is only reachable when CAUDIO_WITH_FETCH_FFMPEG=ON and neither
# system FFmpeg nor a trimmed prefix is available. It does no online fetching;
# the user must install FFmpeg or point FFmpeg_ROOT at a prebuilt tree.
